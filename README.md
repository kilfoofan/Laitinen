# Laitinen
Web-programming project

This project ended up being a patchwork of code, and at this moment I would recode it completely differently using JQuery. One of the major problem is that each dialog is set up so that it requires an individual method to handle. Currently I would use only a few dialogs, as few as possible, and bring in all the id's as lists to differentiate them from eachother.
